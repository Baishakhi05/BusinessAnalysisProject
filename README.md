# BusinessAnalysis_PlanningProject
This project consists of business analysis and process flow mapping for an existing contract management system within a company with an aim to optimize the current system.
To begin with, our company is facing within their procurement department due to lack of necessary tracking in their contract management system.
Inorder to bridge the gap, the current process and expected process to set up a contract was analysed to meet the objective of the changes to be introduced in the contract management suystem.

The issues faced by current system include:
1. No visibility of the line manager in the supplier contract workspace
2. Line manager not able to track status of supplier contracts falling under his/her team
3. No mechanism to track spend data against the products purchased

# Current state
1. The As-is file shows the current state of process flow between procurement profrssional, application support professional and supplier who are collaborating to set up a contract workspace and publish a contract for both new and existing suppliers

#Future state
1. The To-be file shows the future state of the contract publishing process where there is fourth actor i.e. Line manager of the procurement professional, who is providing approval in the system to be added in the contract workspace as a 'Line Manager'. 
2. Following this process, the line managers are provided with an additional tab - 'My Team' within the contract management software where they can view the status of the supplier contracts falling under his/her team.
3. Under 'My Team' tab the line managers can export the data in the form of CSV files to share it with their team and superiors instead of approaching procurement professionals individually, thus saving time and effort
4. Additionally, procurement professionals will be able to add product description from a list of keywords which would allow them to tag their contracts against appropriate products.
5. This will help in tracking spend against tagged products which will also be visible to their line managers under 'My Team' tab.
